Summary:
One of the most widely used approaches to AI is machine learning (ML), a subset of AI that uses statistical methods to enable machines to improve at tasks through experience. Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the field of study that focuses on creating systems capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence. Additionally, the development of artificial general intelligence (AGI)�machines capable of performing any intellectual task that humans can�raises questions about control, safety, and the potential impact on society.

AI draws on concepts from several disciplines including computer science, mathematics, linguistics, psychology, and neuroscience to develop algorithms and models that mimic cognitive functions. However, modern AI systems, particularly those using machine learning, are capable of improving their performance over time by learning from data without explicit programming.
