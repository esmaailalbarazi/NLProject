SUMMARY SCHEMA: num_sentences, SENTENCES/WORDS: only_sentences, ADD KG INFO: no, KG USAGE APPROACH: weight
Summary:
One of the most widely used approaches to AI is machine learning (ML), a subset of AI that uses statistical methods to enable machines to improve at tasks through experience. Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the field of study that focuses on creating systems capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence. Additionally, the development of artificial general intelligence (AGI)�machines capable of performing any intellectual task that humans can�raises questions about control, safety, and the potential impact on society.
